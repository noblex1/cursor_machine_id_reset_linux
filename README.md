📋 System Requirements

Linux system (Ubuntu/Debian/CentOS, etc.)

sudo privileges

Downloaded Cursor AppImage file

Basic tools: openssl, python3, sudo

🚀 How to Use
0. Quick Setup Check
# Run setup script to verify files are correctly placed
./setup_project.sh

1. Preparation

⚠️ Important: All script files must be placed in the same directory as the Cursor AppImage file!

# 1. Create working directory
mkdir cursor_free_vip
cd cursor_free_vip

# 2. Place the following files in this directory:
#    - cursor_free_vip_complete.sh
#    - test_cursor_fix.sh
#    - README.md
#    - Cursor-1.3.9-x86_64.AppImage (you need to download this)

# 3. Check file structure
ls -la
# You should see:
# cursor_free_vip_complete.sh
# test_cursor_fix.sh
# README.md
# Cursor-1.3.9-x86_64.AppImage

# 4. Verify the AppImage file
ls Cursor*.AppImage

2. Run the Complete Fix Script
# Make script executable
chmod +x cursor_free_vip_complete.sh

# Run the fix script
./cursor_free_vip_complete.sh

3. Launch the Modified Cursor
# Recommended: Reboot the system
sudo reboot

# Launch Option 1: Via terminal
./cursor_free_launcher.sh

# Launch Option 2: Application menu (if desktop shortcut was created)
# Applications → Development → Cursor Free VIP

# Launch Option 3: Desktop shortcut (if chosen during setup)

4. Desktop Integration (Optional)

If a desktop shortcut wasn’t created during the fix, you can manually create it later:

# Create desktop shortcut and application menu entry
./create_desktop_entry.sh

# Uninstall desktop integration (if needed)
./uninstall_cursor_free_vip.sh

🔧 Script Workflow

Dependency Check – Ensures required tools are installed

File Check – Locates the Cursor AppImage

System Backup – Backs up critical system files

Process Termination – Stops all Cursor processes

AppImage Extraction – Unpacks the AppImage

System Modifications – Resets system machine ID

Data Cleanup – Deletes all Cursor data

Configuration Rebuild – Regenerates app configs

JS Injection – Patches code to bypass checks

Launcher Creation – Adds custom launch script

📁 Project File Structure
Core Files (Required)

cursor_free_vip_complete.sh – Main fix script

test_cursor_fix.sh – Test/verification script

README.md – Documentation

Cursor-1.3.9-x86_64.AppImage – Cursor installer (download separately)

Helper Scripts

setup_project.sh – Setup verification script

create_desktop_entry.sh – Desktop shortcut creation script

Generated After Running

cursor_free_launcher.sh – Launch script for Cursor

cursor_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/ – Backup folder for system files

squashfs-root/ – Extracted AppImage contents

uninstall_cursor_free_vip.sh – Uninstall script for desktop integration

⚠️ Important Notes
System Impact

Modifying the machine ID may affect license checks of other software

Recommended for use in a virtual machine or test environment

Original files are automatically backed up and can be restored manually

How to Restore

To revert to the original system settings:

# Restore system machine ID
sudo cp cursor_backup_*/machine-id.backup /etc/machine-id
sudo cp cursor_backup_*/dbus-machine-id.backup /var/lib/dbus/machine-id

# Restore Cursor configuration
cp -r cursor_backup_*/Cursor.backup ~/.config/Cursor

🛠️ Troubleshooting
Still getting the "too many" error?

Reboot your system

sudo reboot


Change your network environment

Try a different WiFi network

Use a mobile hotspot

Use a VPN

Wait it out

Try again after 24 hours — the Cursor server may have a time-based lock

Clear browser cache

If Cursor uses any system browser components

FAQ

Q: Do the scripts require sudo access?
A: Yes, modifying the machine ID requires administrative privileges.

Q: Will this affect other software?
A: It might affect licenses for software tied to the machine ID. Use it in a test environment if you're unsure.

Q: How do I completely uninstall?
A: Just delete the generated files and restore system files using the backup.

📝 Technical Background
Detection Mechanism Analysis

Cursor uses multiple layers of identification:

App-Level IDs – Stored in configuration files

System-Level Machine ID – Retrieved from OS files

Hardware Fingerprint – CPU, memory, MAC address, etc.

Network Fingerprint – IP, request patterns, etc.

Bypass Techniques

Reset All Identifiers – Generate fresh random IDs

JavaScript Injection – Override functions that gather hardware info

System File Modification – Change core machine identity files

Environment Variables – Mask runtime properties
